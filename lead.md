  - data exfiltration (logs, prompts, artifacts)
  - privilege escalation (over-broad IAM, tool scopes)
  - supply chain risks (dependencies, container images)
  - impersonation (service identities, tokens)
  - replay attacks / duplicate requests
  - model poisoning / retrieval poisoning

2) AuthN/AuthZ Design
- Human auth: SSO/OIDC (concept)
- Service-to-service auth: mTLS/JWT (concept)
- RBAC model: roles (dev, lead, reviewer, ops, security)
- Fine-grained tool permissions:
  - per-agent tool allowlist
  - per-run scope
  - policy gates before high-risk tools (Terraform apply, repo write)

3) Secrets & Data Handling
- Where secrets live (Secrets Manager/Parameter Store)
- Rotation, access patterns (IRSA), least privilege
- Data classification: public/internal/confidential/regulated
- Logging policy: what to store, what to redact, retention rules
- “Never log”: tokens, keys, raw customer data, credentials

4) Guardrails for Tool Calling
- Input validation: schema + allowlists
- Output validation: strict Pydantic parse + policy checks
- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints for destructive actions
- Dry-run-only mode for Terraform + approvals

5) Security Controls Checklist (interview-ready)
- Network: VPC, private subnets, egress control, security groups
- K8s: pod security, network policies, image scanning
- Audit: immutable audit log, traceability across steps
- Compliance: retention, access reviews, incident response

6) Scenario Drill (answer like a senior)
Scenario: “Agent was tricked by a Jira comment to exfiltrate a secret via PR description.”
Ask me to respond with:
- detection signals (logs/alerts)
- immediate containment steps
- root cause analysis steps
- long-term fixes (policy, tests, tool scopes)
Then provide the ideal answer and a short postmortem template.

7) Interview Q&A (15)
Ask me 15 questions focused on:
- prompt injection defenses
- least privilege for tools/IAM
- safe logging and PII
- secure SDLC + supply chain
Wait for my answers and improve them.

## Day 17 — CI/CD + GitOps + Terraform Policy Gates for Agent-Generated Code (Prompt)

```text
You are my DevOps/MLOps interview coach for building and shipping an SDLC Agent platform.

Today’s goal:
Explain a production-grade CI/CD strategy where agents create PRs, tests run, Terraform plans are validated, and releases are safe (canary + rollback).

Deliverables (must include all):

1) End-to-End Pipeline Design (ASCII)
From: “Jira → agent run → PR created”
To: “merge → deploy → monitor”
Include stages:
- pre-commit checks (lint, type check)
- unit/integration tests
- secret scanning
- SAST/dependency scanning
- container build + SBOM
- Terraform fmt/validate/plan
- policy-as-code gate (OPA/Conftest concept)
- manual approval for high-risk changes
- deploy (canary) + rollback conditions

2) Branching + Environment Strategy
- dev/stage/prod promotion
- versioning (service version + prompt/tool version)
- feature flags for agent behaviors
- artifact repository strategy (Docker images, Helm charts)

3) Terraform Governance
- module allowlist
- remote state handling
- plan review workflow (human + automated checks)
- drift detection
- “no apply by default” rule for agents
- break-glass procedure (how to safely do emergencies)

4) Testing Strategy for Agent Changes
- prompt regression tests (golden inputs → expected outputs)
- schema contract tests for tool calls
- end-to-end workflow tests (mock Jira/GitHub/Terraform)
- canary runs for prompt/tool updates

5) Observability in CI/CD
- build metrics (duration, failure rate)
- deploy metrics (success rate, rollback rate)
- quality gates (PR acceptance, defects)

6) Exercise
Ask me to propose:
- a Jenkins/GitHub Actions style pipeline (high-level YAML steps)
- a policy gate rule example (pseudo OPA)
Then critique and provide improved “ideal” versions.

7) Interview Q&A (12)
Ask me 12 CI/CD questions focused on:
- safe automation, approvals
- secrets in pipelines
- canary + rollback
- GitOps vs push-based deploy
Wait for my answers and refine.
```

## Day 18 — Performance, Latency & Cost Optimization (LLM Inference + RAG + Scaling) (Prompt)

```text
You are my performance/cost interview coach for an LLM-driven multi-agent platform.

Today’s goal:
Be able to optimize latency/throughput/cost for:
- agent orchestration
- LLM inference
- retrieval (vector DB)
- tool calls
…and explain tradeoffs clearly.

Deliverables (must include all):

1) Latency Breakdown (where time goes)
- API overhead
- orchestration decisions
- retrieval + reranking (concept)
- tool calls (Jira/GitHub/Terraform)
- LLM generation (tokens)
Create a simple “latency budget” table and how to measure each part.

2) Inference Optimization Concepts (practical)
- batching: when it helps, when it hurts
- caching: prompt cache + response cache (key design + invalidation)
- streaming: SSE vs WebSocket; why streaming improves perceived latency
- context trimming + token budgeting
- model routing: small vs large model based on task
- fallback strategies when model is slow/unavailable
- quantization concept (4-bit/8-bit) and tradeoffs (quality vs speed)

3) RAG Performance Optimization
- choosing K (top-k), chunk size tradeoffs
- metadata filtering to reduce search space
- hybrid retrieval concept
- indexing choices (HNSW/IVF conceptually)
- warm caches and embedding reuse

4) Platform Scaling Strategy
- queue-based workers + autoscaling (queue depth, CPU, latency)
- backpressure + rate limits per tenant
- concurrency limits per tool / per agent
- circuit breakers for flaky tools
- cost budgets per run (max tool calls, max tokens)

5) Cost Model (interview-ready)
Create an example cost calculation:
- tokens per run × cost/token + infra + vector DB ops
Show how to enforce:
- per-tenant budgets
- alerts on anomalies
- “kill switch” for runaway agent loops

6) Exercise
Give me a scenario:
“Traffic spikes 10×; queue backlog grows; LLM cost doubles.”
Ask me to propose:
- immediate mitigations
- long-term fixes
- which metrics prove success
Then provide the ideal answer.

7) Interview Q&A (15)
Ask me 15 questions around:
- throughput vs latency tradeoffs
- caching correctness
- rate limiting and fairness
- scaling EKS workers
Wait for my answers and refine.

## Day 19 — Evaluation, Rubrics, Data Pipelines & MLOps for Agent Quality (Prompt)

```text
You are my LLMOps/MLOps interview coach for an SDLC agent platform.

Today’s goal:
Be able to prove “agent output quality” with evaluation pipelines, monitoring, and continuous improvement—without overfitting or leaking sensitive data.

Deliverables (must include all):

1) Define “Quality” for SDLC Agents
Create a rubric for each agent:
- Code Gen Agent: correctness, compile/test pass rate, security issues, style
- PR Review Agent: precision of findings, severity correctness, false positives
- Test Agent: coverage gain, flaky tests, relevance
- Terraform Risk Agent: correctness of risk flags, policy compliance
For each rubric: define 5–8 scoring criteria with 0–2 or 0–5 scale.

2) Offline Evaluation Pipeline
- build a “golden set” from past Jira tickets/PRs (with sanitization)
- dataset versioning (DVC-like concept), splits
- evaluation runner that:
  - runs agent prompts/tools in mocked mode
  - scores outputs using rubric
  - tracks regressions per prompt/tool/model version

3) Online Monitoring & Feedback Loop
- capture signals:
  - PR acceptance rate
  - time-to-merge
  - number of review comments reopened
  - incident rate linked to agent-generated changes
  - user feedback (thumbs up/down)
- detect drift and anomalies
- human review sampling strategy

4) CI/CD for Prompts/Tools (LLMOps)
- prompt versioning and rollout
- canary runs + A/B
- rollback triggers based on eval metrics

- safe storage of prompts/responses (what to store vs mask)
- retention policy + access controls

6) Exercise
Ask me to:
- design a minimal “Eval Harness” architecture (ASCII)
- propose 10 golden test cases for “PR Review Agent”
Then critique and provide an improved version.

7) Interview Q&A (12)

Below is an **industry-grade Day 21 “POC Codex Prompt”** you can copy-paste into Codex / any code-gen LLM.

This PoC uses the real Hugging Face dataset **`pacovaldez/stackoverflow-questions`** (fields: `title`, `body`, `label`). ([Hugging Face][1])

```text
You are a Senior AI Engineer building a production-style PoC aligned to this JD:
“Lead Software Engineer (Python + AI/ML) building an AI-Native SDLC Agent Fabric using multi-agent orchestration (LangGraph/AutoGen concepts), MCP-style tool contracts, RAG + vector DB, FastAPI/Pydantic, observability, CI/CD discipline.”

# 🚀 PoC Name
“Ticket2PR Agent Fabric (Mini)”

# 🎯 Objective (what the PoC must do)
Build a small but realistic “SDLC agent fabric” service that:
1) Ingests a REAL Hugging Face dataset into a vector index for retrieval (RAG):
   - dataset: pacovaldez/stackoverflow-questions
   - fields: title (string), body (string), label (int)
2) Exposes a FastAPI API where a user submits a “ticket” (bug/how-to request).
3) Runs a LangGraph-based multi-agent workflow to produce SDLC artifacts:
   - Triage Agent: classify ticket type + severity + risk
   - Retrieval Agent: retrieve top-k similar StackOverflow questions (RAG)
   - Solution Agent: propose fix/answer grounded in retrieved contexts (no hallucination)
   - Test Plan Agent: generate a concrete test plan (and optional pytest snippets)
   - PR Draft Agent: generate PR title/description + checklist + rollout/rollback notes
   - Policy/Verifier Agent: validate JSON outputs, enforce rules, and mark “NEED_HUMAN_APPROVAL” if risky
4) Implements “MCP-inspired” tool contracts:
   - Define tools with JSON schema (name, description, input_schema, output_schema)
   - Provide a ToolRunner that can call local tools safely (timeouts, retries, redaction)
   - Tools to implement (local, no external credentials needed):
     - search_kb(query) -> retrieves chunks from vector store
     - create_pr_draft(ticket, solution, tests) -> returns PR markdown
     - run_policy_checks(artifact) -> returns pass/fail + reasons
     - (optional) run_unit_tests() -> simulated tool that returns a dummy report
5) Provides observability:
   - structured logs with request_id/run_id/step_id
   - basic metrics endpoints (/metrics in Prometheus text format OR simple JSON)
   - tracing-friendly structure (OpenTelemetry optional but nice)
6) Includes an evaluation harness:
   - small golden set (10–20 tickets) stored in repo
   - rubric scoring (helpfulness, grounding, structure, policy compliance)
   - script to run eval and produce a JSON report
7) Must be runnable end-to-end locally with no code edits.

# ✅ Hard Requirements (Do NOT skip)
- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI + Pydantic v2
- LangGraph used for orchestration (real code)
- RAG vector store:
  - Default: FAISS (local) OR Chroma (local) — choose ONE and implement well
  - Optional: Qdrant via docker-compose (bonus)
- Use Hugging Face `datasets` library to load the dataset.
- Ingestion must support sampling (e.g., first N rows) to keep PoC fast.
- All outputs from agents must be structured JSON validated by Pydantic models.
- Add safety rules:
  - “Answer must cite retrieved snippets (at least 2) OR say NOT_ENOUGH_CONTEXT”
  - “Never output secrets”
  - “If ticket indicates destructive actions, mark NEED_HUMAN_APPROVAL”
- Provide clean repo structure, docs, runbook, and tests.
